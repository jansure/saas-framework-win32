### Portable filebrowser with html5 mobile ui. 



**TL;DR**

Portable file server throught http. Uses:

- Share videos/audios on your local network.
- Expose docker volumes to http. 
- Share private server folders online

Run with docker:

```
docker run --rm -v /home/jordi:/tmp -p 8080:8080 jordic/file_server:1.0
```

without docker:

```
wget https://github.com/jordic/file_server/blob/master/builds/file_server_linux_amd64?raw=true
chmod +x file_server_linux_amd64
./file_server_linux_amd64 -dir $HOME  

```
The docker image, can receive env variables:

FILESERVER_AUTH = username:password for handling basic auth

FILESERVER_COMMAND = allow running shell commands from the UI

FILESERVER_DIR = dir to expose

FILESERVER_PORT = port for the service
